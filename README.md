# ðŸŽ¶ðŸŒŠ p2p musical flows experiment ðŸŽ¶ðŸŒŠ
## what is it?
This is an experiment in sending musical data directly from browser to browser using the excellent p2p APIs available in [Agregore Browser](https://github.com/AgregoreWeb/agregore-browser)

I made this as a demo to show at the 2022 Wizard Amigos Code Camp... video coming soon!
## how does it work?
- data gets broadcast to peers by `POST`ing it via the `fetch` interface to a given `pubsub://` URL
- listening happens via an `EventSource` set up for the same URL
- events from the `EventSource` interface get turned into @most/core streams
- @most/core streams and stram transformations are used to glue the application together and modify/select/filter musical data in various ways
- [webmidi.js](https://webmidijs.org/docs/) is used to simplify WebMIDI setup
- the [all-around-keyboard](https://github.com/micahscopes/all-around-keyboard) web component is used for feedback and as a musical interface

## development notes
#### starting a development server at `http://localhost:4321`:
```
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

#### automatically building and publishing changes to hyperdrive
First ensure that you've set up the `hyp` CLI and have created a hyperdrive:
```
> hyp daemon start
> hyp create hyperdrive
```
This will give you a `hyper://` URL for the new hyperdrive. Modify the script in [package.json](./package.json#L17-L18) to use your new hyperdrive URL.

In one terminal start the build in watch mode:
```
> npm start build:watch
```
In another terminal start syncing in watch mode:
```
> npm start hyp:sync
```
Now whenever you make changes, `vite` will build to `./dist` and `hyp` will sync the changes to your hyperdrive.
